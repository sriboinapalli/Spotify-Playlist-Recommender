# Spotify-Playlist-Recommender
Spotify Playlist Recommender is a Machine Learning and Data Analysis Project that attempts to gain as much insight from a user's Spotify playlists. With this project I will attempt to answer questions such as, "Are the statistics that you see on Spotify.me indicative of the content of your playlists". 

In the Data folder, you will be able to see the csv file that I used for data analysis, as well the Python Program that I used to access said data from the Spotify Web API.

In the Analysis and Machine Learning Folder, you will see what I have done with the data in terms of what questions I have answered and how I've utilized Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a song would belong to one playlist or another.
